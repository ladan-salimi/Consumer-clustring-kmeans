# consumer-clustring-kmeans
This code uses a dataset[1] that contains the average annual electricity consumption for different countries in 2018(it should be noted that pre-processing of dataset has been done in another practice). Then, the K-Means clustring has been applied to these countries. The number of clusters has been achived by elbow point method.
